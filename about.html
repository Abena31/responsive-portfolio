            <h1 class="mb-4">Hi I am Abena Obenewaa Addai</h1>
            <h2 class="mb-4">Front-End Developer,based in Virginia.</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">
              Born in Ghana and now residing in America, I am proficient in
              English, French, and Twi and have a deep passion for learning new
              languages. Currently, I am focused on mastering Thai and Korean.
              Rather than specializing in just one area, I possess a diverse
              skill set that allows me to find unique and creative solutions.
              With a bachelor's degree in Nursing, experience as a DevOps
              Engineer, and ongoing coding studies to become a front-end
              developer, I bring a versatile background to the table.
              Additionally, I actively contribute to a foundation that supports
              pregnant women and children in need. Beyond my professional
              pursuits, I find joy in cooking, exploring new places through
              travel, and immersing myself in the world of literature. Sharing
              my culture with others and learning about different cultures is
              something I truly cherish. As I continuously seek
              self-improvement, I am currently on the lookout for new
              opportunities as a Frontend developer. I have a portfolio of
              projects that I have built, which you are welcome to check out.
